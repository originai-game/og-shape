# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Repository created: design, plan and verified research.
- Cargo workspace and `shape-core`: `DVec3` and `Frame`, `trig` (libm),
  exact predicates (`orient2d`, `orient3d`, `incircle`, `insphere`),
  canonical ordering, and the SHA-256 output hash, which refuses NaN.
- The determinism lint: `clippy.toml` denies `std` transcendental maths,
  `mul_add`, `powi`, threads, `HashMap`/`HashSet` and glam's SIMD types.
- The gate: `scripts/check.sh` (fmt, clippy, cargo-deny licences and bans,
  tests, golden hashes natively and as wasm32 under wasmtime), and GitHub
  Actions on x86-64 Linux, x86-64 Windows and aarch64 Linux. The first
  golden hashes cover `shape-core`.
- `shape-gen` and `shape-bool`: origin-engine's og-geom copied at
  `d4f4d4d` (`third_party/og-geom/SOURCE`): three.js's extrude, lathe,
  sweep, polyhedra, merge, and exact-predicate CSG and fracture. og-geom's
  own contract tests pass unchanged, including its recorded output hashes,
  so the copy gives the engine's bytes. Golden cases added for each.
- Phase 0 decision: booleans stay on og-geom's exact-predicate CSG;
  manifold-rust is dropped (`docs/research.md` §5). The benchmark is in
  `bench/booleans`.
- `shape-mesh`: `Solid` (f64 triangles with surfaces, face names and edge
  names), name lookup that lists existing names on a miss, canonical
  ordering, measures, and the output hash.
- `shape-2d`: profiles (`rect` with corner radius, `circle`, `ellipse`,
  `slot`, `polygon`, `poly` with per-corner fillets, `superellipse`, and a
  `Path` with lines, three-point and tangent arcs, Béziers and splines),
  each point flagged sharp or smooth; union, subtract, intersect, xor,
  offset, stroke (i_overlay, integer core), mirror, hull (exact
  predicates), transforms; triangulation by spade's constrained Delaunay
  on the exact contour points. Curves follow one rule: 0.05 mm chord, 24
  to 64 segments a turn.
- `shape-gen::solids`: named generators. `extrude` (twist, taper, both
  sides) names `bottom`, `top`, `side` (and `inner` on hole walls) and the
  edges between them; `revolve` names `side`, `rim`, `start`, `end`;
  `cuboid` (also `left`, `right`, `front`, `back`), `cylinder`, `cone`,
  `tube`, `sphere`, `dome`, `torus`, `wedge`. Every output is canonical.
- Golden cases for profiles, 2D booleans, offsets, triangulation and the
  named generators.
- `shape-2d::gear` (involute spur gear, ISO 53 proportions) and `text`:
  glyph outlines from a font file the caller supplies (ttf-parser; no font
  ships), filled by the non-zero rule, corners where segments turn more
  than about 11°. `outline_profile` takes outline commands directly.
- `shape-gen::paths`: `sweep` along a polyline with rotation-minimizing
  frames (double reflection), twist and end scale (`start`, `end`,
  `side`); `helix`; `thread` (a 60° ridge swept on a helix, faces also
  `thread`); `loft` through stacked sections, straight or Catmull-Rom
  (`bottom`, `top`, `side`).
- `shape-bool::boolean` (phase 2): join, cut and intersect on named solids
  in f64. Faces keep their names, also as `<part>.<tag>`; a cutting
  tool's faces get `cut`; edges where operands meet get `cut`,
  `<target>.cut`, the tool's name and the cap names; pieces of named input
  edges keep their names; named edges between coplanar faces lose them.
  An operand that is not closed and oriented after welding is refused
  with an error value (`docs/research.md` §5.4, follow-up 1).
- `shape-bool::csg_points`: the f64 core of og-geom's CSG on welded
  operands; `csg` and its output bytes are unchanged.
- Plan: aarch64 macOS joins the gate later; phase 0 benchmarks booleans on
  synthetic AI-mesh defects instead of provider outputs, which re-check the
  decision in phase 5.
